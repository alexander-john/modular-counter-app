# Counter App

This is a simple counter application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Increment the counter
- Decrement the counter
- Reset the counter to zero

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Use the buttons to interact with the counter.

## Code Overview

The main functionality is implemented in the `CounterComponent` function within the `app.js` file. This function creates the counter display and the buttons, and attaches event listeners to handle the button clicks.

## Modular Design

The JavaScript code is separated into its own file (`app.js`) to demonstrate a modular design approach. This makes the code easier to maintain and extend.

## Styling

Basic styling is applied directly within the `index.html` file using a `<style>` tag.
